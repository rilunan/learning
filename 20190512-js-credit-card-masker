// javascript practice from codewars

// what did I learn? from the most popular solution, my solution did not include an regex, so I had to reacquiant myself with those

// return masked string
function maskify(cc) {
  // separate cc into individual pieces
  var split = cc.split("");
  // find how many pieces there are
  var length = split.length;
  // establish a holding place for the new string
  var masked = [];
  
  // if the length of the entry is exactly 4, return the entry
  if (length === 4) {
    var maskified = cc;
  } 
  
  // if the length is more than 4, return #+the final four
  else if (length > 4) {
  for (i = 0; i < (length-4); i++) {
  masked.push("#");
  }
  
  masked.push(split[length-4]);
  masked.push(split[length-3]);
  masked.push(split[length-2]);
  masked.push(split[length-1]);
  
  var maskified = masked.join("");
  
  }
  
  // or if it's less than 4, return the entry
  else if (length < 4) {
    var maskified = cc;
  }
  
  // return the desired masked effect
  return maskified;
  
  
}
